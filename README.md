# HTML Learning Project - Web Development Fundamentals

A beginner's first multi-page website built entirely with HTML to demonstrate basic web development concepts.

## Project Overview

This is an educational website about web development fundamentals, created as a learning exercise using only HTML - no CSS or JavaScript. The project showcases basic HTML skills including page structure, navigation, forms, tables, and media embedding.

## Project Structure

```
├── index.html          # Homepage - Internet basics and how it works
├── about.html          # About page - project description and reflection
├── topic1.html         # HTML basics (headings, paragraphs, links, images)
├── topic2.html         # Lists and tables (nested structures)
├── topic3.html         # HTML boilerplate, divs, classes, IDs, file paths
├── topic4.html         # HTML forms (comprehensive guide)
├── topic5.html         # Media tags (video and audio)
└── IFrameLinks/        # Directory containing video embed files

## Features

- **Multi-page Navigation**: Consistent navigation structure across all pages
- **Table-based Layout**: Uses HTML tables for page layout and structure
- **Educational Content**: Covers fundamental web development topics
- **Video Integration**: Embedded YouTube videos using iframes
- **Form Examples**: Comprehensive HTML form demonstrations
- **Responsive Tables**: Basic table structures for data presentation

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and structure
- **HTML Tables**: Page layout and data presentation
- **HTML Forms**: User input demonstrations
- **Iframes**: Video content embedding

## Learning Objectives Covered

1. **Internet Fundamentals**: How the internet works, IP addresses, DNS
2. **HTML Basics**: Elements, attributes, document structure
3. **Content Organization**: Lists, tables, nested structures
4. **Form Creation**: Input types, validation, accessibility
5. **Media Embedding**: Video and audio integration
6. **File Organization**: Relative paths and project structure

## Limitations and Known Issues

### Technical Limitations
- **Table-based Layout**: Uses outdated layout method (not CSS Grid/Flexbox)
- **No Responsive Design**: Fixed-width layout doesn't adapt to screen sizes
- **Code Repetition**: Navigation and structure duplicated across pages
- **Limited Styling**: Basic HTML attributes only, no modern styling

### Accessibility Concerns
- Missing alt text for some images
- Table-based layout creates screen reader challenges
- Limited keyboard navigation support
- No skip links for navigation

### Maintenance Issues
- Changes require editing multiple files
- No template system or includes
- Hardcoded navigation links

## How to View

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Navigate through the site using the provided links

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers including:
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- No JavaScript required
- Basic HTML5 support needed

## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates understanding of:
- HTML document structure and semantics
- Basic web navigation and linking
- Form creation and input types
- Table structures and data organization
- Media embedding techniques
- File path management

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for learning progression:
- Add CSS for modern styling and responsive design
- Implement JavaScript for interactivity
- Convert to semantic HTML5 layout
- Add proper accessibility features
- Create a template system to reduce code duplication

## Resources Used

- Educational content compiled from various web development resources
- AI assistance for content organization and formatting
- YouTube video embedding for multimedia learning
- Reference materials for HTML best practices

## Reflection

This project represents a foundational step in web development learning. While it has limitations typical of beginner projects (table-based layout, repetitive code, basic styling), it successfully demonstrates core HTML concepts and provides a functional multi-page website structure.

The experience highlighted both the capabilities and constraints of pure HTML development, providing valuable insights into why modern web development tools and practices evolved.
