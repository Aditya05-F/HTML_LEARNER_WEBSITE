                <h3>My First HTML Website Experience</h3>
                <p>This is my first attempt at building a multi-page website using only HTML. I just learned the basics
                    of HTML tags like headings, paragraphs, links, and tables. The most challenging part was figuring
                    out how to embed videos, which led me to discover iframe tags.</p>

                <h3>What I Built</h3>
                <p>I created a 6-page educational website about web development fundamentals without using any CSS or
                    JavaScript. The entire structure relies on HTML tables for layout and basic HTML attributes for
                    formatting.</p>

                <h3>Learning Process</h3>
                <p>I used reference materials and AI assistance to create the educational content for each topic. The
                    notes you see on HTML basics, forms, tables, and internet concepts were compiled from various
                    sources and then organized into a beginner-friendly format.</p>

                <h3>What Worked Well for a Beginner</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Table-based layout gave me control over page structure</li>
                    <li>Consistent navigation across all pages</li>
                    <li>Successfully embedded video content using iframes</li>
                    <li>Created working internal links between pages</li>
                    <li>Organized content in a logical learning sequence</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Challenges and Drawbacks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Repetitive Code:</b> I had to copy the same table structure and navigation to every page</li>
                    <li><b>Limited Styling:</b> Without CSS, the website looks very basic and dated</li>
                    <li><b>Table Layouts:</b> Using tables for layout is not the modern approach</li>
                    <li><b>Accessibility Issues:</b> The structure could be better for screen readers</li>
                    <li><b>Mobile Unfriendly:</b> Fixed table widths don't work well on small screens</li>
                    <li><b>Maintenance:</b> Making changes requires editing multiple files</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>This project taught me the fundamentals of HTML structure, file organization, and how web pages
                    connect together. I discovered how much work goes into even a simple website and gained appreciation
                    for CSS and modern web development tools.</p>

                <p>While the approach has limitations, it was a valuable learning exercise that helped me understand
                    basic web development concepts from the ground up.I built It in total 3 session each of 2 to 3
                    hours(In total 9 hours).Used AI for Notes and  faster development but the idea and all the structure all are original and belongs to me . I feeling very confident after finishing it.</p>
